# 📊 Dashboard (Frontend)

This is a React frontend project for visualizing pipeline data as backend is not yet implemented. The dashboard uses hardcoded data to simulate conversion metrics across sales stages. It is designed as a foundation for future data-driven enhancements as backend is not yet implemented.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Data Visualization**: Displays simple stage-to-stage conversion using colored bars.
- **Static Data**: Data is hardcoded in the frontend (fetching is not done yet).
- **Basic Styling**: Clean and minimal UI built with plain CSS (non-responsive).
- **Single Chart Component**: The dashboard is built around a reusable `chart2.jsx` component.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

These features are **not yet implemented** ❌:

- ⚠️ Use of Material UI and D3.js for charting (Custom CSS used for now ). 
- ⚠️ Fetch data from `data.json` file (Data is hardcoded for now).
- ⚠️ Responsive design for mobile, desktop, and 4K screens (Non-Responsive Design Currently).
